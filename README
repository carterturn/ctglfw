ctglfw
=======

CT GLFW Wrapper is part of the Terca C++ libraries.
GLFW is a third party library, CT GLFW Wrapper
merely provides a set of convenient classes.

Installing
==========

This library uses a standard makefile.
You will need to have the following
libraries installed before attempting
to install ctglfw:
	-OpenGL
	-GLFW
	-FTGL
If these libraries are not installed
with "standard" paths, you may have
to modify the makefile.
Note that if you are not on a GNU/Linux
system, you will probably need to change
the install directories. You may also
need to change the compiler. The default
is gcc.
To build and install use:

make
sudo make install

Please note that you need to do:
sudo make uninstall
before reinstalling if you decide to make
any changes to CT GLFW Wrapper.

Usage
=====

There is example code in test.cpp.
Consulte this first, then check the
".h" files for available functions.
Please note that unless you choose
to modify "cttextbox.cpp", there
must be a "font.ttf" file for the
font in any executables local
directory.

Libraries
=========

Terca C++ GLFW Wrapper uses OpenGL, GLFW, and
FTGL. Licenses for GLFW and FTGL can be found
in GLFW_LICENSE and FTGL_LICENSE files,
respectively. OpenGL (as far as I can tell)
is free to use in applications.
